## 🧠 What You Can Build with These Files

Using this repo, you can quickly build:

* **AI Email Agent** that reads → understands → drafts → replies.
* **RAG Agent** to answer questions using your documents.
* **Voice Assistant Backend** for any webpage or product.
* **Automation Pipelines** for business tasks.
* **Multi-agent systems** using LLM + n8n.

---

## 📦 Requirements

To fully use these workflows, ensure you have:

* n8n (self-hosted or cloud)
* API access to one of the following:

  * OpenAI
  * Cohere
  * Google Gemini
* Google Sheets access (if using workflow-integrated sheets)

---

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/n8n-agents
   ```

2. Import the workflow files into your n8n instance.

3. Add API credentials under **n8n → Credentials**.

4. Connect nodes according to the workflow.

5. Run or schedule the flows.
